# Introduction to FortuneCookies
FortuneCookies is a game of art and luck on Ethereum. Each FortuneCookie is a collectible good luck charm that contains a surprise! Players collect and trade FortuneCookies to maximize their GoodFortune, a form of digital luck that exhibits special powers.

FortuneCookies are produced in limited edition batches designed in collaboration with a unique artist. Everything from the design of the charm and the surprise inside, to the number of FortuneCookies produced, are part of the artist's intended experience. When you own a FortuneCookie, you actually own the digital rights to the associated art. Crack one open to see for yourself!

FortuneCookies batches are sold during official Bake Sales, which will be pre-announced on official FortuneCookies Twitter, Medium, and Telegram accounts at least a week prior. Batches are limited edition, so when they're gone they're truly gone – no more reprints can ever be made. Visit the [Official Bake Sale](www.fortunecookies.io/bakesale) to buy your FortuneCookie. If the Bake Sale is closed, FortuneCookies may be available for resale at popular collectibles exchanges like [RareBits](www.rarebits.io), [SuperRare](www.superrare.co), or [OpenSea](www.opensea.io).

FortuneCookies are secured by Ethereum. Technically, FortuneCookies are ERC721 tradeable tokens on the Ethereum blockchain (see ERC721: Non-Fungible Tokens). Because your FortuneCookies live on Ethereum, your GoodFortune will last for generations.

## Collect Digital FortuneCookies
FortuneCookies are collectible charms with a surprise.

### The Charm
The charm is the exterior shell of the FortuneCookie, and contains the surprise hidden inside. All charms are the same for a whole batch, which makes it easy to associate your FortuneCookie with a batch when it's in your wallet – since the charm also functions as your collectibles icon.

### The Surprise
The surprise is the goodness hidden inside your FortuneCookie that reveals itself to the player that opens the FortuneCookie for the first time. We achieve this by using your Ethereum address to generate pseudorandomness, which assigns you a resultant surprise from the available batch. Unlike regular fortune cookies, FortuneCookies surprises are actually made-for-you.

### The Batch
FortuneCookies Batches are limited edition releases that can produce anywhere between 1 and 1 million new FortuneCookies. Batches are the main grouping of FortuneCookies in the game; FortuneCookies from the same Batch have the same Charm – and they usually share similar surprises. Players are restricted to holding only 1 FortuneCookie from each batch at a time.

Batches are designed in collaboration with an artist. The entire experience of the batch, from the number of FortuneCookies produced, to the charm and the surprise hidden inside, are the vision of the artist.

### The Bake Sale
Bake Sales are official FortuneCookies events when new FortuneCookies are sold to the public. Most Bake Sales will occur on our website, however some may occur offline or in person for special occasions. Bake Sale types include:
* Reverse Auction: fixed quantity; high > low variable price; sold sequentially.
